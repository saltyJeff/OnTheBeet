* Brocolli cops: will accept an exponentially growing amount of money as a bribe and let you go. Be aware: once
you have $0 you will go bankrupt and lose the game
* Carrot marshalls: these incorruptible officers will instantly end the game once you're caught

Try to get the most money possible in 60 seconds!
